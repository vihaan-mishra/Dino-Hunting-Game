# vihaan-Dino-Hunting-Game

## What
This game is played with dice. There are:
6 green dice: these have dinosaurs on 3 sides, leaves on 2 sides, and a foot on 1 side
4 yellow dice: these have dinosaurs on 2 sides, leaves on 2 sides and feet on 2 sides
3 red dice: these have dinosaurs on 1 side, leaves on 2 sides, and feet on 3 sides

Each round, whoevers turn it is randomly selects 3 dice and rolls them. Dice that have a dino on top are kept to the side and added to your score. Dice that have a leaf on top are returned back to the pile and dice that have a foot on top are kept aside and counted seperately. You can reroll until you run out of dice or until you roll 3 feet. At that point you miss your turn and all points in that round are lost.

Whoever has the most points at the end of all the rounds wins.
